# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Background 
In this project, I used the two different earthquake maps and the earthquake overlay to display the data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth.  I displayed all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and visualized that data on a third map.

### Deliverable 1
Add Tectonic Plate Data

### Deliverable 2
Add Major Earthquake Data

### Deliverable 3
Add an Additional Map
